 This code runs on Hubitat and will connect to a Denkovi Web Relay.   I've used this to convfigure my pool and automations, control sprinklers and soon a future thermastat migration.
 
 I use PoE based Ethernet with a Ethernet Splitter Adapter Cable 48V to 12V DC connected to a Denkovi smartDen IP-Maxi Module
