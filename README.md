Denkovi Hubitat Drivers for Denkovi smartDen IP-Maxi Module

This code runs on Hubitat and will connect to a Denkovi Web Relay.   I've used this to configure my pool automation, control sprinkler systems and soon a future thermostat migration.   I borrowed some coding from the Hubitat Community and this is a first release.    The Denkovi has 8 web relays to control and can be web managed. This code does XML queries to post and get settings and polls every 1 minute.
 
I used PoE based Ethernet with a Ethernet Splitter Adapter Cable 48V to 12V DC connected to a Denkovi smartDen IP-Maxi Module
